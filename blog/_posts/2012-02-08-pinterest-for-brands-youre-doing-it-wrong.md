There’s a lot of buzz around [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/) lately, and brands are taking notice of the [huge (vanity) numbers they’re already generating](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/pinterest-monthly-uniques/). Early talks about leveraging the traffic for brands are usually centered around two things: Getting the brand’s products on Pinterest and dissecting the interest and purchase potential of each pin or board.

I think they’re wrong.

Coming straight from the horse’s mouth: “Pinterest is connecting people all over the world based on shared tastes and interests." Pinterest isn’t about getting people to pin your stuff, it’s about connecting _different_ pins under a common emotion or interest. We each have a style/home/wedding/food board, but they’re all unique. I can follow an individual board because _that’s_the connection we have - not the items inside.

So here’s the (right) idea: Let your brand suggest an open-ended board and let the users control the pins. Create some promo that allows users to connect whatever they want to a designated board.

What’s in a suitcase for the tropical vacation they book with your airline?

What’s as important to their daily routine as checking your brand’s mobile phone?

Where will your brand’s car take them? What’s in the trunk?

Open the entire web to a potential connection to your brand and make every pin worthy of fitting into your branded board. It’ll make that board the most interesting one to follow and connects the most people to your product/service.  Pinterest becomes a subtle hint whenever we’re browsing the web - “Hey, that reminds me of [your brand]’s board."

Let’s try not to figure how we can squeeze the same tired “Look at me!" idea into every hip, new trend. Instead, make that service another reminder that you’ll meet them anywhere on the web. Soon enough they’ll see you everywhere they look.
