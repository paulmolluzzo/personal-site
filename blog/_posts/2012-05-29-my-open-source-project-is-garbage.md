In my defense, I’m more hacker than developer. I am a CodeAcademy dropout. I -steal- am inspired by other people’s source.

But recently I decided to do something different. After a couple of folks asked me to build a single page website I thought, “Why not just make a template and still charge the full amount?’ Then I took it a step further, “Why not make it open source so other (real) developers can reuse it?"

[So I wrote a little one page website template called JustaPage.](http://paulmolluzzo.github.com/JustaPage/demo) I wrote the HTML, CSS and jQuery for the demo and a template to download from scratch. I fleshed out documentation and wrote an informative README. I tinkered and scratched my head and showed friends for over a week. Finally, I pushed my very first open source project to GitHub for all the world to see.

Then these Piccsy people had to come along with their [awesome one page site](http://piccsy.com/investors/). It’s so cool! It made me feel so bad about the project I published less than 24 hours before. I’m tempted to just delete my stupid repo and cry into my keyboard.

But actually this is why I like to write code. I like to find things way better than anything I can do. When someone else writes something really slick I want to figure out how they did it. I flip through their site, then open up their source to see how it all works. I bookmark the site, or download and watch the repo.

I keep looking for new, better web because maybe the stuff I come across will spark an idea for a future client. Or maybe it’ll keep me busy in TextMate until 1am. Or maybe I’ll just… borrow it.
